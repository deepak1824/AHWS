# AHWS
Automated Home Waste Separator based on Arduino Uno R3
AUTOMATED HOME WASTE SEPARATOR
Feb 2016 – May 2016

Project descriptionAs my final year project, my team and I built an “AUTOMATED HOME WASTE SEPARATOR” on an Arduino Uno R3. The prototype was successfully tested for separation of wet, dry and metallic waste with the controlled use of several sensors and motors.

- Developed the C code for waste detection.
- Interfaced inductive proximity sensor, capacitive sensors and IR sensors with arduino uno.
- Interfaced the servo and DC motors appropriately so that the waste falls in right bin.
- Tool: Arduino IDE, Language: Embedded C
